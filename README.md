## Installation üöÄ

### Ollama

You need to have Ollama installed on a machine with a URL accessible by the API.

Please follow the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) for installation instructions.

### Running the API

You need to configure the following properties:

- `singularities.app.jwtSecret` = Your JWT secret (e.g., generated with a JWT secret generator)
- `spring.mail.host` = Your SMTP provider host
- `spring.mail.username` = Your SMTP provider username
- `spring.mail.password` = Your SMTP provider password
- `app.name` = Your app name (e.g., Singularities AI)
- `app.url` = Your frontend URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7000)
- `app.url.client` = Client URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7000)
- `spring.ai.ollama.base-url` = Your Ollama server URL (e.g., http://localhost:11434)

Then, start the application using Maven:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
````

### Running the Frontend

1. Update the `.env` file:

```env
API_URL=Your API URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the application using the scripts available in `package.json`.
